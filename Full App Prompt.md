Semi Facebook clone with scheduling-

1. Core Technologies and Infrastructure:

Backend (Server-Side):
Programming Language:
Python (with Flask ): Great for rapid development and has extensive libraries.

Database:
MySQL : Relational databases for structured data (users, posts, etc.).
MongoDB: NoSQL database, useful for flexible data structures (for photos and videos).

Frontend (Client-Side):
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: The foundation of web development.
Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS: CSS frameworks for responsive design.

Authentication and Security:
HTTPS: Essential for secure communication.
Password hashing (bcrypt, Argon2): Securely store passwords.
Session management or JWT (JSON Web Tokens): Manage user sessions.
Input validation and sanitization: to prevent security vulnerabilities.

2.1 Key Features and Implementation:

User Management:
Registration and Login: Implement secure authentication with password hashing.
User Profiles: Store user data (name, profile picture, bio, etc.).
User Settings (Edit User): Allow admins to modify user data.
Forgot Password: Implement password reset functionality.
Content Creation and Sharing:
Posts: Allow users to create text, image, and video posts.
Post Preview: Provide a preview of posts before publishing.
Scheduling: Implement a feature to schedule posts for future publication.
Social Interaction:
Dashboard: Display user data in tables and charts (e.g., activity, engagement).
User List: Show a list of all users.
Website Pages:
Home Page: Welcome message and application description.
About Page: Information about the platform and its purpose.
Contact Page: Contact form or information.
Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy: Essential legal pages.
Error Handling:
404 (Page Not Found): Display a user-friendly 404 page.
500 (Internal Server Error): Display a 500 error page for server-side issues.
Scheduling:
A database field to store the date and time a post is scheduled for.
A background task (e.g., using cron jobs or a task queue) to check for scheduled posts and publish them.
Data Visualization:
Libraries like Chart.js (JavaScript) or Matplotlib (Python) can be used to create charts.
Tables can be created with HTML tables or data table libraries.

2.2Enhanced the frontend templates with:
   - Modern card designs with subtle shadows and rounded corners
   - Smooth transitions and hover effects
   - Responsive layouts that work well on all devices
   - Improved dark mode support
   - Better visual hierarchy and spacing

2.3 Added proper backend support with:
   - Complete analytics API endpoints for real-time metrics
   - New FollowerCount model to track audience growth
   - Enhanced Post and PlatformAccount models with analytics-related methods
   - Background task for updating follower counts every 6 hours
    - Improved error handling and logging for better debugging

3. Development Workflow:

Planning: Define your features and user stories.
Design: Create wireframes and mockups of your pages.
Development:
Start with the backend (database, API).
Then, build the frontend.
Implement authentication and authorization.
Add features incrementally.
Testing: Thoroughly test your application (unit tests, integration tests, user testing).
Deployment: Deploy your application to your chosen server.

4. Important Considerations:

Security: Prioritize security to protect user data.
Scalability: Design your application to handle future growth.
User Experience (UX): Create a user-friendly and intuitive interface.
Privacy: Be transparent about how you handle user data.
Maintenance: Plan for ongoing maintenance and updates.
