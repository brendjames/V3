# Development Guidelines & Best Practices

These guidelines outline the recommended approach to development for this project.  Following these practices will contribute to a more organized, efficient, and successful development process.

**Task-Based Development Workflow**

We advocate for a task-based development methodology. For each development task, the recommended workflow is as follows:

1.  **Test Definition:** Begin by writing comprehensive tests that define the expected behavior of the feature or functionality you are about to implement.
2.  **Code Implementation:**  Develop the code necessary to fulfill the requirements and pass the tests you have defined.
3.  **Testing and Verification:**  Execute the tests to ensure that the implemented code functions correctly and meets the defined specifications.

**Project Requirements: Referencing the README.md**

Thoroughly review the `README.md` file to fully understand the project requirements and the specific features that need to be implemented.  **This step is crucial for ensuring project success.**  The README provides essential context and direction for development efforts.

**Feature Prioritization: Sequential Implementation**

Adopt a sequential approach to feature implementation. Begin with the first feature outlined in the project requirements and systematically work your way down the list. This structured approach promotes focused development and reduces complexity.

**Project Memory and State Management**

To maintain project continuity and context across development sessions, a dedicated memory file is essential.

*   **Create `memory.md`:** Establish a `memory.md` file within the project repository.
*   **Purpose:** Utilize this file to document the current state of the project, record important notes, and store relevant details that need to be recalled between development interactions.
*   **Maintain Up-to-Date Information:**  Ensure the `memory.md` file is consistently updated to reflect the project's current status and any changes or key decisions made.
*   **Task Tracking:** Task completion will be tracked within the designated To-Do list and should **not** be annotated within the `memory.md` file to avoid redundancy and maintain clarity.

**Adaptive Development Guidelines**

These guidelines are intended to be dynamic and responsive to the evolving needs of the project.  If, during the course of development, new insights or more effective practices emerge, **update these guidelines accordingly** to reflect those learnings and improve the overall development process.

## Social Media Feature Integration for the Finance Platform

To enhance user engagement and platform interactivity, we will integrate social media features into the finance application. This section outlines proposed features and the implementation plan.

**Proposed Social Features**

The following social features are recommended to complement the finance platform and enhance user experience:

1.  **User Profiles:** Implement personalized user profiles where individuals can showcase their investment history, trading methodologies, and professional background.
2.  **Friend/Follow System:** Enable users to establish connections by following other users whose investment strategies or insights they find valuable.
3.  **Activity Feed:**  Create a centralized activity feed that aggregates recent trading activities and portfolio adjustments from users a given user follows.
4.  **Investment Groups/Communities:**  Facilitate the formation of or joining investment-focused groups where users can engage in strategy discussions and collaborative learning.
5.  **Trade Sharing Functionality:**  Provide users with the option to share completed trades, accompanied by their rationale and commentary, to foster transparency and knowledge sharing.
6.  **Performance Leaderboards:**  Establish leaderboards that rank users based on objective performance metrics, such as portfolio growth percentage, to introduce a competitive element.
7.  **Comments and Reactions System:**  Implement a system for users to comment on shared trades or react to posts using emojis or text-based feedback, promoting interaction and discussion.

## Implementation Roadmap for Social Features

The implementation of social features will follow a structured, phased approach. The following roadmap outlines the key stages:

**Phased Implementation Plan**

1.  **Database Schema Modifications:**  The initial step involves extending the existing database schema to accommodate the social features. This includes the creation of new tables: `profiles`, `followers`, `posts`, `comments`, `likes`, `groups`, and `group_members`.  These tables will store the data required for the social functionalities.
2.  **Route Definition and Implementation:**  New routes will be implemented within the Flask application to handle user interactions with social features. These routes include: `/profile`, `/profile/<username>`, `/feed`, `/follow`, `/unfollow`, `/post/new`, `/post/<post_id>`, `/groups`, `/group/<group_id>`, and `/leaderboard`.
3.  **User Profile Enhancement:** The user registration and profile system will be enhanced to include additional profile details, such as bio information, profile picture management, and privacy configurations.  The profile page will be expanded to display portfolio performance metrics, trading activity summaries, investment philosophy statements, follower/following counts, and potentially achievement badges.
4.  **Frontend Interface Development:**  Modifications to the frontend templates and layout are required to integrate social features into the user interface. This includes developing new templates for social feeds, user profiles, post creation, and comment sections, as well as updating navigation elements.
5.  **Trade Sharing Implementation:**  The trade execution process will be augmented to allow users to optionally share their trades with accompanying commentary. Shared trades will become content for the social activity feed, driving user engagement.

## Next Steps: Proceeding with Implementation

To initiate the implementation process, the following immediate steps are recommended:

1.  **Database Schema Extension:** Begin by modifying the database schema to incorporate the new tables required for social features.
2.  **User Profile Enhancement Development:**  Implement the enhancements to user profiles, focusing on data storage and display of expanded profile information.
3.  **Follow/Follower System Implementation:**  Develop the functionality for users to follow and unfollow other users, building the foundation for the social network aspect.
4.  **Activity Feed Construction:** Build the social activity feed, ensuring it aggregates and displays relevant content from followed users.
5.  **Posting and Commenting Feature Development:** Implement the features for users to create posts, add comments, and react to content, fostering user interaction.
6.  **Groups and Leaderboard Implementation:**  Develop the group functionality and leaderboards to complete the set of social features.

Let's commence with the database schema modifications. Please indicate when you are ready to proceed with Step 1.
